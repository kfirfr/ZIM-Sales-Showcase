# The "Show, Don't Tell" Rule
Never just list features. You must build **Interactive Micro-Apps** for every section.

# Creative Directive
- **Invent the Detail:** If the user prompt is vague, YOU must fill in the gaps with high-tech details (e.g., if asked for "Analytics," invent a specific "Sentiment Confidence Score" visualization).
- **Motion is Mandatory:** Nothing should be static. Numbers should tick up/down. Graphs should draw themselves.

# Simulation Patterns
1. **The "Live Scan":** For text analytics, show a "scanning" animation (a glowing line moving over text) before revealing the insights.
2. **The "Node Connect":** For routing, draw lines connecting Users to Agents with pulsing dots traveling along the line.
